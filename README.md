# Rat in a Maze

This web app brings to life the famous rat in a maze problem. It visualizes all the possible paths a rat can take in a square maze with fixed obstacles. 

There is a given maze of size N x N. The source and the destination location is top-left cell and bottom right cell respectively. Some cells are valid to move and some cells are blocked. The rat can take only one step to the right or down at a time. If the rat starts moving from start vertex to destination vertex, we have to find if the rat can reach the destination, if it is possible then the correct paths for the rat are marked.
